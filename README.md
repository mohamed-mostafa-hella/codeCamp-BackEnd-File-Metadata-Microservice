# [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

## Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/.

### steps. 

- You can submit a form that includes a file upload.

- The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.

- When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

## Hint.
- I use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package to handle file uploading.

## Note.
- like [ sample.env ] => Create .env file that contain [PORT = 'your port'].
